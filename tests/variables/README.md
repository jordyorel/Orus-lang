## Test Categories

### Basic Tests
- Variable declarations
- Variable assignments
- Mutable vs immutable variables
- Variable scoping

### Arithmetic Tests
- Arithmetic operations with variables
- Compound assignment operators
- Variable calculations

### Benchmarks
- Performance comparisons of different variable patterns
- Memory usage optimization tests

### Boundaries
- Testing with extreme variable counts
- Edge cases in variable scoping

### Errors
- Invalid variable declarations
- Assignment to immutable variables
- Undefined variable access

### Edge Cases
- Complex variable scenarios
- Unusual but valid variable patterns

### Advanced
- Advanced variable patterns
- Complex scoping scenarios

### Integration
- Variables combined with functions, loops, etc.
