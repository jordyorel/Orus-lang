## Test Categories

### Basic Tests
- Binary expressions (+, -, *, /, %)
- Boolean expressions (and, or, not)
- Comparison expressions (<, >, ==, etc.)
- Complex expressions

### Arithmetic Tests
- Mathematical expressions
- Operator precedence
- Parentheses grouping

### Benchmarks
- Performance comparisons of different expression types
- Optimization tests

### Boundaries
- Testing with extreme values
- Edge cases in mathematical operations

### Errors
- Invalid expression syntax
- Type mismatches in operations

### Edge Cases
- Complex nested expression scenarios
- Unusual but valid expression patterns

### Advanced
- Advanced expression patterns
- Complex operator combinations

### Integration
- Expressions combined with functions, variables, etc.
