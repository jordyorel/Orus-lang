## Test Categories

### Basic Tests
- Simple if/else statements
- Ternary operators
- Nested conditionals
- Boolean expressions

### Arithmetic Tests
- Conditionals with arithmetic operations
- Comparison operations
- Mathematical conditions

### Benchmarks
- Performance comparisons of different conditional patterns
- Optimization tests

### Boundaries
- Testing with extreme values
- Edge cases in boolean logic

### Errors
- Invalid conditional syntax
- Type mismatches in conditions

### Edge Cases
- Complex nested scenarios
- Unusual but valid conditional patterns

### Advanced
- Advanced conditional patterns
- Complex boolean logic

### Integration
- Conditionals combined with loops, functions, etc.
