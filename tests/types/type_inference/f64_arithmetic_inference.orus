// Comprehensive f64 arithmetic type inference tests
let a: f64 = 1.5
let b: f64 = 2.5

// All basic operations should infer f64 type
let addition = a + b
let subtraction = a - b  
let multiplication = a * b
let division = a / b

print(addition)      // 4.0
print(subtraction)   // -1.0
print(multiplication) // 3.75
print(division)      // 0.6

// Chained operations should also infer f64
let complex = (a + b) * (a - b)
print(complex)

// Mixed with literals should infer f64
let with_literal = a + 3.14
print(with_literal)
