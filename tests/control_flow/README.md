## Test Categories

### Basic Tests
- for loops, while loops
- break and continue statements
- Nested loops
- Range-based loops

### Arithmetic Tests
- Loops with arithmetic operations
- Loop counters and calculations

### Benchmarks
- Performance comparisons of different loop types
- Optimization tests

### Boundaries
- Testing with extreme iteration counts
- Edge cases in loop conditions

### Errors
- Invalid loop syntax
- Incorrect break/continue usage

### Edge Cases
- Complex nested loop scenarios
- Unusual but valid control flow patterns

### Advanced
- Advanced loop patterns
- Complex control flow logic

### Integration
- Control flow combined with functions, conditionals, etc.
