# Orus Programming Language

**Orus** is a fast, elegant programming language that brings together the best of modern language design: Python's readability, Rust's safety, and blazing performance from a register-based virtual machine.

---

## 🎯 Why Orus?

### **Performance First**
Built on a register-based VM with computed-goto dispatch, Orus outperforms Python by **7×**, JavaScript by **11×**, and even competes with Lua. No JIT warmup time, just consistent speed.

### **Readable & Expressive**
Clean indentation-based syntax that feels natural. Write less boilerplate, express more meaning:

```orus
fn fibonacci(n: i32) -> i32:
    if n <= 1: 
        n
    else: 
        fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

let result = fibonacci(10)
print("Result: {}", result)
```

### **Safe by Default**
Static typing with intelligent inference. Catch errors at compile time, not runtime:

```orus
let numbers: [i32] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let evens = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]  # Type-safe comprehensions
```

### **Modern Features**
Pattern matching, generics, error handling, and modules - everything you expect from a 2025 language:

```orus
enum Result<T>:
    Ok(value: T)
    Error(message: string)

match parse_number("42"):
    Result.Ok(num): print("Parsed: {}", num)
    Result.Error(msg): print("Failed: {}", msg)
```

## 🚀 Language Overview

### **Variables & Types**
```orus
let name = "Alice"           # inferred as string
let age: i32 = 25           # explicit typing
let mut score = 0           # mutable variable
```

### **Control Flow with Advanced Loop Safety**
```orus
if score > 100:
    print("High score!")
elif score > 50:
    print("Good job!")
else:
    print("Keep trying!")

# Advanced range syntax with steps
for i in 0..20..2:
    print("Even number: {}", i)

# Automatic infinite loop protection
while processing:
    do_work()  # Runtime guards prevent runaway loops
```

### **Structs & Methods**
```orus
struct Player:
    name: string
    health: i32

impl Player:
    fn new(name: string) -> Player:
        Player{ name: name, health: 100 }
    
    fn take_damage(mut self, damage: i32):
        self.health -= damage
```

### **Error Handling**
```orus
try:
    let result = risky_operation()
    print("Success: {}", result)
catch err:
    print("Error: {}", err)
```

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### **Build Orus**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd orus-reg-vm
make clean && make
```

### **Try the REPL**
```bash
./orus
```
```
orus> let x = 42
orus> print("Answer: {}", x)
Answer: 42
```

### **Run a Program**
```bash
echo 'print("Hello, Orus!")' > hello.orus
./orus hello.orus
```

### **Development Mode**
```bash
./orus --trace program.orus    # Trace VM execution
./orus --debug program.orus    # Enable debugging
```

## 🧬 Architecture & Performance

### **Register-Based VM**
Unlike stack-based VMs (Python, JavaScript), Orus uses a register architecture that:
- Eliminates stack push/pop overhead
- Enables better instruction-level optimization
- Provides more efficient memory access patterns

### **Computed Goto Dispatch**
```c
// Instead of slow switch statements:
switch (instruction) { case OP_ADD: ...; }

// Orus uses computed goto:
goto *dispatch_table[instruction];
```

### **Fast Arithmetic**
Optimized integer operations without overflow checking in release builds, specialized opcodes for common patterns.

### **Memory Management**
Mark-and-sweep garbage collector with object pooling, automatic memory reclamation, and configurable thresholds for optimal performance.
